Naming Patterns for Metrics
The _unique suffix indicates that this metric shows the number of unique users who performed a specific action. Metrics generated with the _unique suffix are approximate and may not be 100% accurate.
The _login and _logout suffixes indicate whether someone was logged into or out of Facebook.
The _source suffix indicates that the metric will be broken down into a list of referral sources. External referrals are broken down by domain. Internal referrals are broken down by Facebook-specific features such as 'Profile', 'Search', 'Requests', 'Suggestions', 'Stream', etc. In these case the value returned will be an object containing a series of key-value pairs where the key is the source name and the value is the metric for that source.
Metrics that are marked with * are available in real-time, i.e., they are refreshed approximately every 15 minutes. Most other metrics will update once every 24 hours.
